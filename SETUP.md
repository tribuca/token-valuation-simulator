# Utility Token Price Simulator Setup
Utility Token Price Simulator is a simulator that simulates general token price when setting parameters. <br/> It is implemented based on the theory of "[Tokenomics: Dynamic Adoption and Valuation](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/WP_2018-49.pdf)". <br/> CUI mode or GUI mode can be used.  

> You can't use this tool for speculative purposes.

## GUI mode
### Prerequisites
- docker
- docker-compose

### Setup  

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tribuca/token-valuation-simulator.git
$ cd utility-token-price-simulator
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up  # may take some time...
```

### Simulation
- Access `http://localhost:3000` through a browser.
- Set the parameters and simulate.

### Clean Up
After the simulation, you should remove containers with the command below.

```
$ docker-compose down
```

## CUI mode 
### Prerequisites
- python3 (It has been confirmed to work with version 3.7.3)

### Setup

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tribuca/token-valuation-simulator.git
$ cd utility-token-price-simulator
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Simulation
- Edit `config.json` to set the parameters.
- After that, execute the following command.

```
$ python3 main.py
```

- Finally, `glaph.png` is output.
